GravitySimulation
=================

To pratice functional programming I decided to make a gravitational simulation using racket's(scheme) universe framework.


How to use
==========

1. Download [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/download/)
2. Open gravity-simulation.rkt with the DrRacket IDE
3. Hit Run and have fun!


Try changing the initial velocity of the space bodies to see how they react. :)
